		<p>My name is Robert and this is my website. This space allows we to host my own privite Computer Science
		projects. I have always loved computer technology and I am finally able to explore my hobby a little deeper.
		I will showcase my various projects with the hope to inspire others to create. </p><br>
		

		<p>I coded this entire website by hand, using examples and lessons from <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a>. The main pages are coded 
		using basic HTML and CSS. No scripts we used in the construction of the website...yet. </p><br>

		
		<p>We are currently running through AWS on Debian 10. This is the third deployment I have created with AWS. 
		My primary expertise in remote devops is with the Linux family of operating systems, mostly Debian.</p><br>


		<p>From this Virtual Private Server platform I will be able to deploy several web technologies, building a resume of 
		services I am able to work with. The 4th quarter of 2020 will see the deployment of a few Django Webframework projects.</p><br>


		<p>By creating this site with HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap4 allows me to create the site the way I want to without having to
		worry about being in the confines a specific framework. The only thing I need is text editor and a terminal. Nano
		has become my new best friend. It's interesting seeing the construction of web media from the inside out with the 
		basic bulding blocks that will be used in other frameworks.</p>
